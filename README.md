# Simulation-Project-154

### disease.py
Run disease.py in terminal for a visualized demo representing 1 run of the simulation. 

### data_analysis.py
data_analysis.py is where we will create functions to collect data from running the simulation. Results are stored in accompanying JSON files and graphs are created as pngs. Don't run this if you don't want the previous data in the repo to be overwritten 

### percentage_data_n1000.json & percentage_data_n10.json
Data from running the simulation in terms of actual number of agents infected on average across all runs / total number of agents in the simulation
One represents 1000 runs and the other represent 10 runs 

#### n1k_graph.png & n10_graph.png
Graphs representing the data from the json files above
