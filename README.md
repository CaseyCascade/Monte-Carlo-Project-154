# Simulation-Project-154
Run disease.py in terminal for a visualized demo
data_analysis.py is where we will create functions to collect data from running the simulation. Results are stored in accompanying JSON files and graphs are created as pngs

### actual_data.json
Data from running the simulation in terms of actual number of agents infected on average across all runs / total number of agents in the simulation

### percentage_data.json
Exact same Data as the actual_data.json simulation run, except with the values converted to a percentage of the total number of agents included in the simulation
